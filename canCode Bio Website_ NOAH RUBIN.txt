My name is Noah Rubin, and I am a 9th Grader at the Claire and Emanuel G. Rosenblatt High School at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, Florida. I have a passion for engineering, computer science, and community service. Last year I started canCode as a way to share my passion for computer programming.


I started canCode when I saw the gap in most traditional elementary schools - no
computer programming logic introduction or instruction. That’s where canCode comes in! Through canCode workshops, I can share my passion and inspire kids!
