     <p align="left">My name is Noah Rubin, and I am in the class of 2021 at the Claire and Emanuel G. Rosenblatt High School at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, Florida. I have a passion for engineering, computer science, and community service. In 2016, I started canCode as a way to share my passion for computer programming.
     <br><br>
		 I started canCode when I saw the gap in most traditional elementary schools - no computer programming logic introduction
		 or instruction. That’s where canCode comes in! Through canCode workshops, I can share my passion and inspire kids!</p>

  	  <img class="profilePicture" src="Images/harys.jpg"><br>
        	  <p>My name is Harys Dalvi and I am a student at
              American Heritage Boca Delray graduating 2021. When I was six years old, I was introduced to Scratch programming. At first, I was very confused. Although I had all the coding blocks in front of me, I didn’t understand what code was! I learned slowly because I didn’t have a teacher. I want to change that.
			<br><br>
  	  Today, as a high schooler, I can program in Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Using skills learned in Scratch, I have developed many video games and even this website! I am passionate about teaching coding so students can contribute to our increasingly computer-oriented world.

  	  <p>My name is Alex Mark and I am a student at
				American Heritage High School graduating 2021. I have a strong passion for programming
				that pushes me to constantly learn new things. However, I wasn’t
				always this way.
				<br><br>
				Before middle school, I had not even heard of
				programming, much less had an interest in it. I feel that if I had
				been exposed at an earlier age, I could have accomplished much more
				than I did. I want to give kids the chance to do things that other
				people don’t start until college.</p>    </div>

     <img class="profilePicture" src="Images/alexgaynor.jpg"><br>
  	 <p> My name is Alex Gaynor and I am a student at Spanish River High School graduating in 2021. I first learned coding in elementary school in a very basic program. Then, in 6th grade, my keyboarding teacher showed us a basic coding game; I had so much fun with it and this sparked my interest. My largest passions are in math, engineering, and computer science.
</br></br>My main goal in life is giving everyone the same opportunity and canCode is all about this. Every child through canCode is given the opportunity to experience coding as I did. It's so powerful watching the children have so much fun doing what you are passionate about and did as a kid.</p>

      <p>My name is Nash Zheng and I am in the class of 2020 at Spanish River High School.
        I was first introduced to computer programming sometime in middle school. I remember learning how to use
        Scratch and the joy that came with making my sprite move around on the screen. Learning
        Scratch taught me to think critically about organization and logic and helped me to explore other languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python.<br>
        <br>Through canCode, I want to help other kids experience the fun and excitement around coding as early as
        possible. My goal is to inspire them to explore coding as they get older and to hopefully, discover a passion for it.</p>

    <p>Ethan Is a passionate 10th grader who loves teaching and technology. During his 9th grade year attending Olympic
      Heights High School he became aware of canCode and was immediately drawn to the program because of its combination
      of both his passions. Additionally, Ethan is a member of FIRST Robotics Team 3932 (The Dirty Mechanics) and heads
      up the IT team, leads the Data Recon Team and has been offered the opportunity of lead technician of the drive team.
      In his free time he engineers new worlds and develops automation within Minecraft.</p>

   <p>My name is Jacob Abramchaev, and I am in the class of 2022 at the Claire and Emanuel G. Rosenblatt
     High School at Donna Klein Jewish Academy. I was first introduced to the Python programming language
     through a CodeAcademy course. After finishing the course along with all the projects I just wanted
     to do more. I built a web app, and when I got an iPhone I was inspired to learn Xcode.</br></br>
     Through canCode, my goal is to introduce younger children to the wonders of Computer Programming and to inspire them to do more.

 <p>Hi! My name is Yakov Wahnich and I am a high schooler at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, graduating in 2021. I was first introduced to Scratch through a basic programming class it took during elementary school. I loved the program, thought it was fun, and always wanted to learn how to do more with it. This sparked an interest in me to pursue coding and engineering, which has turned into my passion! Every child should have that opportunity, just as I did.
 <br><br>Through canCode, your child will have a blast learning how to program. Scratch is a great foundation for your child if they find coding interesting and have the desire to continue doing it down the road. At canCode, we create a fun and safe learning environment for your child and simplify learning materials so every child can easily understand and absorb each lesson. We hope to see you here soon!</p>
