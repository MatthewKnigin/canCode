      My name is Gabriella Davis, and I’m a student at Olympic Heights graduating class of 2022! My relationship with
      programming had a rocky start but after a while I’ve grown to truly appreciate the subject and really enjoy teaching
      it as well. Today, I’m an active member of the FRC community for two years and this helps me with teaching too!
      Along with robotics I also actively participate in debate competitions every month and have achieved high placements
      before. In the future, I’m looking forward to potential careers in engineering or law, and I hope to encourage kids
      to pursue their interests in whatever they choose!

      My name is Chris Colella and I am a student at Saint John Paul II Academy graduating in 2023.
      I’ve always enjoyed anything that had to do with computers, and my passion was further explored
      when I was introduced to scratch in elementary school. This interest led me to explore programs
      like C++, Java, and mostly Python.<br><br>
      By teaching at CanCode, I am able to share this passion with other kids, and hopefully have at
      least one of them look into a career having to do with coding.

                      introduced me to JavaScript through Khan Academy. When I was taught the basics I wanted more,
                      so I finished the entirety of JavaScript at Khan academy in the following weeks. After that
                      I learnt Python and now I am starting HTML and CSS. I am currently part of the FTC team at
                      Saint Andrew’s. My main passions are engineering, programming, physics, math, and history.<br><br>
                      What I want to achieve in life is everyone to be educated, especially in programming. Through canCode,
                      I can do this because it gives all kids an opportunity to learn to program. Because they get this opportunity,
                      I hope they get a passion for programming, and someday become a programmer in whichever field they choose.

        and coding is now my greatest passion. Now, I know Java, Python, HTML and CSS.<br><br>
        When I learned about Cancode, I was eager to become an instructor. I want everyone to have the
        opportunity to learn Scratch just like I did. I believe that coding is such an essential skill
        in this day and age and everyone should learn how to code. Outside of school and cancode,
        I am the Founder and President of my school’s Cybersecurity team, the President of the Computer
        Science Club and the Captain of FIRST Tech Challenge team 9986. I am also the Secretary of the NBPS Engineering Club
        and a Member of FIRST Robotics Competition team 5410.

  <p>My name is Jacob Abramchaev, and I am in the class of 2022 at the Claire and Emanuel G. Rosenblatt
    High School at Donna Klein Jewish Academy. I was first introduced to the Python programming language
    through a CodeAcademy course. After finishing the course along with all the projects I just wanted
    to do more. I built a web app, and when I got an iPhone I was inspired to learn Xcode.</br></br>
    Through canCode, my goal is to introduce younger children to the wonders of Computer Programming and to inspire them to do more.

 <p>Hi! My name is Yakov Wahnich and I am a high schooler at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, graduating in 2021. I was first introduced to Scratch through a basic programming class it took during elementary school. I loved the program, thought it was fun, and always wanted to learn how to do more with it. This sparked an interest in me to pursue coding and engineering, which has turned into my passion! Every child should have that opportunity, just as I did.
 <br><br>Through canCode, your child will have a blast learning how to program. Scratch is a great foundation for your child if they find coding interesting and have the desire to continue doing it down the road. At canCode, we create a fun and safe learning environment for your child and simplify learning materials so every child can easily understand and absorb each lesson. We hope to see you here soon!</p>

  <p>My name is Nash Zheng and I am in the class of 2020 at Spanish River High School.
    I was first introduced to computer programming sometime in middle school. I remember learning how to use
    Scratch and the joy that came with making my sprite move around on the screen. Learning
    Scratch taught me to think critically about organization and logic and helped me to explore other languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python.<br>
    <br>Through canCode, I want to help other kids experience the fun and excitement around coding as early as
    possible. My goal is to inspire them to explore coding as they get older and to hopefully, discover a passion for it.
