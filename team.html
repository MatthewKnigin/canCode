     <p align="left">My name is Noah Rubin, and I am in the class of 2021 at the Claire and Emanuel G. Rosenblatt High School at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, Florida. I have a passion for engineering, computer science, and community service. In 2016, I started canCode as a way to share my passion for computer programming.
     <br><br>
		 I started canCode when I saw the gap in most traditional elementary schools - no computer programming logic introduction
		 or instruction. That’s where canCode comes in! Through canCode workshops, I can share my passion and inspire kids!

        	  <p>My name is Harys Dalvi and I am a student at
              American Heritage Boca Delray graduating 2021. When I was six years old, I was introduced to Scratch programming. At first, I was very confused. Although I had all the coding blocks in front of me, I didn’t understand what code was! I learned slowly because I didn’t have a teacher. I want to change that.
			<br><br>
  	  Today, as a high schooler, I can program in Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Using skills learned in Scratch, I have developed many video games and even this website! I am passionate about teaching coding so students can contribute to our increasingly computer-oriented world.

  	  <p>My name is Alex Mark and I am a student at
				American Heritage High School graduating 2021. I have a strong passion for programming
				that pushes me to constantly learn new things. However, I wasn’t
				always this way.
				<br><br>
				Before middle school, I had not even heard of
				programming, much less had an interest in it. I feel that if I had
				been exposed at an earlier age, I could have accomplished much more
				than I did. I want to give kids the chance to do things that other
				people don’t start until college.</p>    </div>

  	 <p> My name is Alex Gaynor and I am a student at Spanish River High School graduating in 2021. I first learned coding in elementary school in a very basic program. Then, in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, my keyboarding teacher showed us a basic coding game; I had so much fun with it and this
       sparked my interest. My largest passions are in math, engineering, and computer science. Read my extended bio <a href="https://cancode.us/team/alexg">here</a>.
<br><br>My main goal in life is giving everyone the same opportunity and canCode is all about this. Every child through canCode is
given the opportunity to experience coding as I did. It's so powerful watching the children have so much fun doing what you are passionate
about and did as a kid.</p>

      <p>My name is Nash Zheng and I am in the class of 2020 at Spanish River High School.
        I was first introduced to computer programming sometime in middle school. I remember learning how to use
        Scratch and the joy that came with making my sprite move around on the screen. Learning
        Scratch taught me to think critically about organization and logic and helped me to explore other languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python.<br>
        <br>Through canCode, I want to help other kids experience the fun and excitement around coding as early as
        possible. My goal is to inspire them to explore coding as they get older and to hopefully, discover a passion for it.

       <p>My name is Gabriella Davis, and I’m a student at Olympic Heights graduating class of 2022! My relationship with
         programming had a rocky start but after a while I’ve grown to truly appreciate the subject and really enjoy teaching
         it as well. Today, I’m an active member of the FRC community for two years and this helps me with teaching too!
         Along with robotics I also actively participate in debate competitions every month and have achieved high placements
         before. In the future, I’m looking forward to potential careers in engineering or law, and I hope to encourage kids
         to pursue their interests in whatever they choose!</p></div>

      <p>My name is Akhil Deo and I am a part of the class of 2021 at North Broward Preparatory School. I
        am also an IB Diploma candidate. In fifth grade, I started learning how to code in Scratch. I
        didn’t realize what everything meant or how it all worked, but I was able to figure it out
        and coding is now my greatest passion. Now, I know Java, Python, HTML and CSS.<br><br>
        When I learned about Cancode, I was eager to become an instructor. I want everyone to have the
        opportunity to learn Scratch just like I did. I believe that coding is such an essential skill
        in this day and age and everyone should learn how to code. Outside of school and cancode,
        I am the captain of my school’s cybersecurity team, the vice president of the computer
        science club and the secretary of the engineering club. I am also a member of FIRST Robotics
        Competition team 5410 and FIRST Tech Challenge team 9986.

       I’ve always enjoyed anything that had to do with computers, and my passion was further explored

      <p>My name is Luca Qumsieh and I am a student at Saint Andrew’s school graduating 2023.
        My first experience with programming was in the 6<sup>th</sup> grade when my science teacher
        introduced me to JavaScript through Khan Academy. When I was taught the basics I wanted more,
        so I finished the entirety of JavaScript at Khan academy in the following weeks. After that
        I learnt Python and now I am starting HTML and CSS. I am currently part of the FTC team at
        Saint Andrew’s. My main passions are engineering, programming, physics, math, and history.<br><br>
      What I want to achieve in life is everyone to be educated, especially in programming. Through canCode,
      I can do this because it gives all kids an opportunity to learn to program. Because they get this opportunity,
      I hope they get a passion for programming, and someday become a programmer in whichever field they choose.</p>

 <p>Hi! My name is Yakov Wahnich and I am a high schooler at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, graduating in 2021. I was first introduced to Scratch through a basic programming class it took during elementary school. I loved the program, thought it was fun, and always wanted to learn how to do more with it. This sparked an interest in me to pursue coding and engineering, which has turned into my passion! Every child should have that opportunity, just as I did.
 <br><br>Through canCode, your child will have a blast learning how to program. Scratch is a great foundation for your child if they find coding interesting and have the desire to continue doing it down the road. At canCode, we create a fun and safe learning environment for your child and simplify learning materials so every child can easily understand and absorb each lesson. We hope to see you here soon!</p>
