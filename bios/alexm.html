<h3>Extended Bio</h3>
<p><b>Current school:</b> American Heritage Boca Delray (graduating 2021)</p>
<p><b>My favorite scratch program:</b> <a class="favoriteColor" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/211116983/" target="_blank">Estimating Pi</a><br>
  One of my first experiences with higher math was when I learned about pi in elementary. I was so fascinated with it that I would sit in the back of 
  the classroom and memorize digits. By the end of 5th grade I memorized over 80 digits! 
  This scratch program shows an intuitive way to estimate pi with an experiment that a kid can perform in real life.</p>
<p><b>My favorite part of teaching</b> is when I learn something new from one of the students. 
  This way we both end the day a little smarter than when we woke up.</p>
<p><b>I joined canCode because</b>  because I wanted to give kids the opportunity to learn one of the most important skills to have in the 21st century.</p>
<p><b>Outside of canCode</b> I am deeply involved with my school's math team and I compete in several competitions every year. I also tutor children in math, program for fun, 
  perform research in artificial intelligence at FAU, and play soccer through SABR.</p>
