<h3>Extended Bio</h3>
<p><b>Current school:</b> American Heritage Boca Delray</p>
<p><b>My favorite scratch program:</b> <a class="favoriteColor" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128326/" target="_blank">Stick Survival</a><br>
  This is a game I made in fifth grade based on Minecraft. It is about surviving on an uninhabited island
  and making tools until being rescued by a plane.</p>
<p><b>My favorite part of teaching</b> is seeing kids who are genuinely interested in what
  they're learning and want to get better not because someone told them to, but because
  they really want to learn and have fun.</p>
<p><b>I joined canCode because</b> I have a passion for computer programming, and I would have loved
  to be taught at a young age. I also enjoy teaching in general and the satisfaction it gives me.</p>
<p><b>Outside of canCode</b> I do math competition, scientific research, and some programming for fun.
  My favorite part of programming is web design (I am a webmaster of this website.)</p>
