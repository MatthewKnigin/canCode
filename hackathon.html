		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Join us for our first ever hackathon! Join as an individual or part of a team of up to 3 teens. In this hackathon, you’ll be challenged to make a project in Scratch (a block-based coding environment) and an accompanying curriculum. You’ll earn 6 hours of community service if you submit a finished project link, regardless of if you win or not. canCode primarily teaches elementary schoolers computer programming through the creation of a video game or project and winning submissions will be used for some of our future workshops! 
		</p>
		<p>All participants must register, and there is a $10 registration fee (note this fee is a donation to our 501c3 nonprofit and helps us provide underserved children with free computer programming workshops). Fee waivers are available for anyone who needs - just email info@canCode.us
		</p>
		<p>Winners will receive recognition, medals, and canCode swag!
		</p><p>
		Schedule:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Join the Kickoff Zoom at 1pm and learn more about canCode, see example projects, and more</li>
				<li>Work with your team until 4pm on your project before submitting</li>
				<li>Join the Judging and Awards Zoom at 5pm to see the winning projects and hear award announcements</li>

<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Yes! For the first time ever, we are teaching workshops for the Public Library System, and you can sign your child up <a href="http://events.pbclibrary.org/events/digital-activities?field_title_of_activity_value=canCode&field_location_tid_selective=All&field_digital_activity_type_value_selective=All" target="_blank">here</a>. Other than that, we currently teach at <a href="https://www.cancode.us/sites">these sites</a>. These centers require your child to be enrolled. However, we are looking to expand our teaching.
