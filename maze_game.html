<h1>Maze Game</h1>
<p>Already made the maze game? Looking for a challenge to make it even better? Try one of these!</p>
<h2>Challenge 1</h2>
<h3>Make the enemy say things!</h3>
<p>You already made the player say things. But the enemy is a very important part of the game too. What if the enemy could say things? Try to figure out how to make the enemy say things just like the player does.</p>
<p>Hint- Switch to the Enemy Sprite under the stage, and use a "<b>When the Flag is Clicked</b>" and a "<b>Say</b>" block.</p>
<div class="panel" onclick = "solution1()" id="showSolution1"><p>Show Solution</p></div>
<div class="panel hidden" id="solution1">
	<p style="text-align: left;">Here is how to make the enemy say "got you" when you touch it. You can make it say whatever you want!<br>
	1. Go to the Enemy Sprite under the stage. Add a <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block.<br>
	2. Add a <b>forever</b> block under the <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block. Inside the <b>forever</b>, add an <b>if...then</b> statement. Make sure the <b>if...then</b> is <i>inside</i> the <b>forever</b>, not outside!<br>
	3. Go to the sensing section. Find where it says <b>touching mouse-pointer?</b>. Drag this block into the <b>if...then</b> statement. Click on the triangle next to where it says "mouse-pointer" and choose your game's player. Make sure this block goes into the <b>diamond-shaped part</b> of the <b>if...then</b>!<br>
	4. Inside the <b>if...then</b>, add a <b>Say Hello! for 2 secs</b> block. Change the "Hello!" to "Got you!" or whatever else you want.<br>
	5. Test your game. Does it work? If not, check and make sure you did everything correctly. Your code should look like this:<br>
	<img src="Images/tutorial1.png">
	</p>
</div>
<p>Test your game. If it works, congratulations, you have completed this challenge! If not, don't give up: go back and make sure you didn't make any mistakes. If you still can't figure it out, try looking at the solution.</p>
<h2>Challenge 2</h2>
<h3>Make the enemy chase the player!</h3>
<p>Right now, the enemy just moves to certain places. It doesn't know where the player is. Try to make the enemy move towards the player. Make sure it isn't too fast, or the game will become too hard!</p>
<p>Hint- Switch to the Enemy Sprite under the stage, and use a "<b>When the Flag is Clicked</b>" and a "<b>point towards</b>" block in the motion section.</p>
<div class="panel" onclick = "solution2()" id="showSolution2"><p>Show Solution</p></div>
<div class="panel hidden" id="solution2">
	<p style="text-align: left;">Here is how to make the enemy move towards the player.<br>
	1. Go to the Enemy Sprite under the stage. Add a <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block.<br>
	2. Remove the code that makes the enemy move from one place to another.<br>
	3. Add a <b>forever</b> block under the <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block. Inside the <b>forever</b>, add an <b>point towards mouse-pointer</b> block.<br>
	4. Click on the triangle next to where it says "mouse-pointer" and choose your game's player.<br>
	5. Under the <b>point towards</b> block, add a <b>move 2 steps</b> block. You can find this in the motion section. Change this number to make the enemy faster or slower. Make sure this block is <i>inside</i> the <b>forever</b>, not outside!<br>
	6. Test your game. Does it work? If not, check and make sure you did everything correctly. Your code should look like this:<br>
	<img src="Images/tutorial2.png"><br>
	7. If the enemy flips upside down, click on the Enemy Sprite under the stage and click on the letter <b>i</b> in the corner. Where it says "rotation style", click on the left-right option:<br>

	</p>
</div>
<p>Just like the other challenge, first try to figure it out by yourself. If you still can't figure it out, try looking at the solution.</p>
<h3>Congratulations! You have finished all the challenges!</h3>
