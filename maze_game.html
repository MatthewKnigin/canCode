<h1>Maze Game</h1>
<p>Already made the maze game? Looking for a challenge to make it even better? Try one of these!</p>
<h2>Challenge 1</h2>
<h3>Make the enemy say things!</h3>
<p>You already made the player say things. What if the enemy could say things too? Try to figure out how to make the enemy say things just like the player does.</p>
<p>Hint: switch to the Enemy Sprite under the stage, and use a "<b>When the Flag is Clicked</b>" block and a "<b>Say</b>" block.</p>
<p>Test your game. If it works, congratulations, you have completed this challenge! If not, don't give up: keep trying and check the code for any mistakes. Maybe you put a block in the wrong place, forgot a block, or programmed the wrong sprite.
If you still can't figure it out, take a peek at the solution and then try it out for yourself.</p>
<div class="panel showSolution" onclick = "toggleSolution('1')" id="showSolution1">
	<p>Show Solution</p>
</div>
<div class="panel solution" id="solution1">
	<p class="left">Here is how to make the enemy say "got you" when you touch it. The fun part is you can make it say whatever you want!<br>
	1. Go to the Enemy Sprite under the stage. Add a <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block.<br>
	2. Add a <b>forever</b> block under the <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block. Inside the <b>forever</b>, add an <b>if...then</b> statement. Make sure the <b>if...then</b> is <i>inside</i> the <b>forever</b>, not outside!<br>
	3. Go to the sensing section. Find where it says <b>touching mouse-pointer?</b>. Drag this block into the <b>if...then</b> statement. Click on the triangle next to where it says "mouse-pointer" and choose your game's player. Make sure this block goes into the <b>diamond-shaped part</b> of the <b>if...then</b>!<br>
	4. Inside the <b>if...then</b>, add a <b>Say Hello! for 2 secs</b> block. Change the "Hello!" to "Got you!" or whatever you want.<br>
	5. Your code should look similar to this:<br>

</div>

<h2>Challenge 2</h2>
<h3>Make the enemy chase the player!</h3>
<p>You have already made the enemy move around the stage. How cool would it be if the enemy knew where the player was and followed it? Try to make the enemy follow the player. Make sure the enemy isn't too fast, or the game will become too hard to play!</p>
<p>Hint: switch to the Enemy Sprite under the stage, and use a "<b>When the Flag is Clicked</b>" block and a "<b>point towards</b>" block from the motion section.</p>
<p>Test your game. If it works, congratulations, you have completed this challenge! If not, don't give up: keep trying and check the code for any mistakes. Maybe you put a block in the wrong place, forgot a block, or programmed the wrong sprite.

<div class="panel showSolution" onclick = "toggleSolution('2')" id="showSolution2">
	<p>Show Solution</p>
</div>
<div class="panel solution" id="solution2">
	<p class="left">Here is how to make the enemy move towards the player.<br>
	1. Go to the Enemy Sprite under the stage. Add a <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block.<br>
	2. Remove the code that makes the enemy move from one place to another.<br>
	3. Add a <b>forever</b> block under the <b>When the Flag is Clicked</b> block. Inside the <b>forever</b>, add an <b>point towards mouse-pointer</b> block.<br>
	4. Click on the triangle next to where it says "mouse-pointer" and choose your game's player.<br>
	5. Under the <b>point towards</b> block, add a <b>move 2 steps</b> block. You can find this in the motion section. Change this number to make the enemy faster or slower. Make sure this block is <i>inside</i> the <b>forever</b>, not outside!<br>
	6. Your code should look similar to this:<br>
	<img src="Images/tutorial2.png"><br>
	7. If the enemy flips upside down, click on the Enemy Sprite under the stage and click on the letter <b>i</b> in the corner. Where it says "rotation style", click on the left-right option:<br>
