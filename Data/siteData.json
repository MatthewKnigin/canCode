In 4th grade, I was introduced to Scratch through my school, and I have been into coding ever since.             I am also on the FIRST Robotics Team 3932, The Dirty Mechanics. I am so glad I am able to teach other kids Scratch through canCode, just as I had been taught Scratch when I was younger. It is amazing to see kids who are so excited and engaged in coding!",
