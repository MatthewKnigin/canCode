<h1>Parent Resources</h1>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>canCode is a small group of high school teachers committed to teaching your children how to code. We make learning to code an educational, enriching, and entertaining experience for your children.</p>
<h2>What do we teach?</h2>
<p>We use <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, a fun and interactive free online coding environment developed by MIT. Our first project will teach how to create a maze game from “scratch” in Scratch. Students will design their own individual mazes and fun characters.<br><br>
Under the <a href="student.html">Student section</a> of this website, we have put together a set of interesting challenges for students who would like to try coding on their own.</p>
<h2>How can I enroll my child?</h2>
<p>We teach at the <a href="http://www.yacboca.org">Youth Activity Center (YAC)</a> in Boca Raton, Florida. You do not have to buy any supplies for your child: the YAC already has computers that they have offered to let us use. We usually meet at the YAC on Mondays from about 4 PM to 5 PM.</p>
