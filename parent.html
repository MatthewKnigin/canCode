<h1>Parent Resources</h1>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>canCode is a small group of high schoolers committed to teaching your children how to code. We make learning to code an educational, enriching, and entertaining experience for your children.</p>
<h2>What do we teach?</h2>
<p>We use <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, a fun and interactive free online coding environment developed by MIT. Our first project will teach how to create a maze game from “scratch” in Scratch. Students will design their own individual mazes and fun characters.<br><br>
Under the <a href="student.html">Student section</a> of this website, we have put together a set of interesting challenges for students who would like to try coding on their own.</p>
<h2>Can I enroll my child?</h2>
<p>We currently only teach at the Youth Activity Center in Boca. This center requires your child to be in the YAC program already. However, we are looking to expand our teaching.
Would you like us to teach at your location? Ask your location to fill out <a>this form</a>.</p>
