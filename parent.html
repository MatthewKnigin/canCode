<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>canCode is a small group of high schoolers committed to sharing our passion for computer programming with your kids. We make learning to code an educational, enriching, and entertaining experience for your children. Most of the time, they don't realize they are learning; but the skills we teach them in canCode workshops are the same that will get them jobs later in life. Our only payment is when your kids love what they're doing.</p>
<h2>What do we teach?</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, a fun and interactive free online coding environment developed by MIT. canCode's Maze Game curriculum was written and perfected by Noah Rubin. Our first project will teach how to create a maze game from “scratch” in Scratch. Students will design their own individual mazes and add fun characters. We are in the process of implementing a second curriculum also developed by Noah, the Drop Game Curriculum for more advanced students. Over time, our curriculum will build with the children's interest and skills. If your child has completed the maze game and wants to learn more, direct them to the <a href="student">Student Resources</a> page. There, we have put together a set of interesting challenges for students who would like to try coding on their own.</p>
<h2>Can I enroll my child?</h2>
<p>We currently only teach at <a href="https://www.cancode.us/sites">a limited number of sites</a>. These centers require your child to be enrolled. However, we are looking to expand our teaching.
Would you like us to teach at your child's after-school program? If you're in Palm Beach County, ask your location to visit our <a href="https://cancode.us/contribute">Contribute</a> page.</p>
